Prior to the digital world that he currently operates in, Barry created many infamous double exposure images the old fashioned way. Barry is retired, but that hasn’t slowed him down in the ‘creativity’ department.</div>

As he got older, our fridge just didn’t do justice to his creations!” Jack has had his images showcased in a number of art magazines. He currently is employed full time at an Auckland Photographic Art Studio for his creativity.</div>
